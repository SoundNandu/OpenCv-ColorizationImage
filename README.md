# OpenCv-ColorizationImage

 First, we convert the image to gray. The function that does that is cvtColor().
 The first argument is the image to be converted, the second is the color mode.
 COLOR_BGR2GRAY stands  for Blue Green Red to Gray.
 You must have heard of the RGB color scheme. OpenCv does it the other way round-
 so blue is first, then green, then red.'''
